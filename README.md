# constructor-word-guess

This app takes the idea of a constructor style of declaration and creates a terminal based word guess game out of it, kind of like Hangman.

The way the game works is that it uses the theme of colors as all the answers. The player is greeted and told to enter their name and then asked if they are ready to begin playing.
