# constructor-word-guess

This app takes the idea of a constructor style of declaration and creates a terminal based word guess game out of it, kind of like Hangman.

The way the game works is that it uses the theme of colors as all the answers. Once the user (in terminal) enters node index.js, the player is greeted and told to enter their name and then asked if they are ready to begin playing. Should the user select that they are not ready to begin playing, the game will say Good bye (name here)! Come back soon!

Should the user say that they are ready to begin playing, however, the game will prompt the user by saying: Let's begin!

The game will tell the user how many total letters the word that they are to guess contains. The word list contains words consisting from 3 to 10 letters, and will all be colors. If the user ends up guessing an incorrect answer, their guesses left variable (which starts at 10) will tick down and they will have 1 less guess to get the right answer. If the user guesses a correct letter, that letter will appear on screen, to help aid in understanding what the color is. Should the user run out of guesses, it's game over! However, if the user guess the right answer, they will be congratulated, and told that they really know their colors!

Thank you so much for taking the time to look at my code and game of constructor word guess!
